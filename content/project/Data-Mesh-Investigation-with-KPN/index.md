Over the past six months, I and some colleagues have collaborated on a project at a large German automotive manufacturer. The project's goal has been to develop a methodology for creating metadata for data products in an internal data exchange market that addresses the challenges of interoperability, reusability, and findability as data products evolve. We've generated four reports and held an interactive seminar on data product metadata modelling as part of this collaboration. An academic paper describing our insights to a broader audience is currently in the making.
