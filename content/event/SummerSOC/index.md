summary: As invited speaker at the 16th Symposium and Summer School On Service-Oriented Computing I presented my research on decentral data exchanges and data markts in general.
abstract: "Centralised, Monolithic Data Platforms struggle to scale with heterogeneous data sources and use cases. Decentral Data Exchanges are promising alternatives but their novelty makes them hard to investigate. We explored the existing literature on Data Markets, which are better understood and discuss how the lessons learned are relevant for decentral data exchanges such as data mesh, data space and enterprise data markets."
