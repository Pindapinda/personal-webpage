summary: As an invited speaker at Mercedes-Benz's internal architect conference "Hey Architect! 22", I presented my insights on internal data markets, data meshes, data products and in particular how to design metadata management solutions within these new approaches.
# abstract: "Centralised, Monolithic Data Platforms struggle to scale with heterogeneous data sources and use cases. Decentral Data Exchanges are promising alternatives but their novelty makes them hard to investigate. We explored the existing literature on Data Markets, which are better understood and discuss how the lessons learned are relevant for decentral data exchanges such as data mesh, data space and enterprise data markets."
