summary: As an invited speaker at Mercedes-Benz's internal architect conference "Hey Architect! 22", I presented my insights on internal data markets, data meshes, data products and in particular how to design metadata management solutions within these new approaches.
abstract: Decentralised data exchanges are promising alternatives to traditional, monolithic data lake and warehouse. At the same time, novel frameworks such as data meshes, data markets, and data spaces, shift the responsibility of providing data from central data offices towards domain-oriented data providers. In theory, this removes some of the bottlenecks of traditional data management solutions. In practice, the road towards achieving such goal is a long way ahead. In this talk, Stefan Driessen will discuss the findings of his research on metadata management for these new approaches in industrial settings.
